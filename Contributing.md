# Contributing

We love pull requests. Here's a quick guide.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:<you>/vimfiles.git

Then, Set it up on your machine: [install guide][install]
    
[install]: https://github.com/imajes/vimfiles/blob/master/README.md

Make your change. Make sure it loads correctly

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/imajes/vimfiles/compare/

At this point you're waiting on me. I try to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). I may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests. (not sure what the best plugin for this is yet?)
* Follow a style guide (not sure which yet?)
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
